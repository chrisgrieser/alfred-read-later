## Item Previews
Install [AlfredExtraPane](https://github.com/mr-pennyworth/alfred-extra-pane)
for previews of the items.

## Items are saved locally
- The items are saved in a local markdown file on your disk. You can set the
  location in the [workflow
  configuration](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/user-configuration/).
- The items are formatted in the [markdown task syntax](https://simpledev.io/lesson/task-list-md-1/).
	+ Unread items as open tasks: `- [ ] [title](url)`
	+ Read items as completed tasks: `- [x] [title](url)`
- This has several advantages:
	+ No dependency on any read-later service.
	+ The reading list is available offline.
	+ Since Markdown is a widely supported format, you can access your items in
	  many other apps as well, such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
	  (Interoperability)
	+ Easy backup: Just copypaste the file.
	+ Easy sync: Just save the file in a cloud drive like iCloud.
	+ By saving in a cloud drive, you can also access the reading list on mobile
	  with any editor app that supports Markdown tasks.

## Credits
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in touch.
