## Usage
- Use the keyword `rl` to add the current tab of the frontmost browser to your
  read-later-list.
- Any item in your reading list also shows up when using the keyword `rl`.
  Press <kbd>‚èé</kbd> to open the item in your browser and remove it from your
  read-later-list.

> [!NOTE]
> [Unfortunately, Firefox is not and cannot be supported.](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/16748-how-to-do-x-in-firefox-from-alfred/)

## Items are saved locally
- The items are saved in a local markdown file on your disk. You can set
  the location in the [workflow configuration](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/user-configuration/).
- The items are formatted in the [markdown task syntax](https://simpledev.io/lesson/task-list-md-1/).
	+ Unread items as open tasks: `- [ ] [title](url)`
	+ Read items as completed tasks: `- [x] [title](url)`
- This has several advantages:
	+ No dependency on any read-later service.
	+ The reading list is available offline.
	+ Since Markdown is a widely supported format, you can access your items in
	  many other apps as well, such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (Interoperability).
	+ Easy backup: Just copypaste the file.
	+ Easy sync: Just save the file in a cloud drive like iCloud.

> [!TIP]
> You can also access the list on mobile with any note-app that supports
> markdown tasks, when you save it in a Cloud Drive.
